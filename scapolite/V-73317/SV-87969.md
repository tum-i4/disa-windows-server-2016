## /rule

The maximum password age must be configured to 60 days or less.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The longer a password is in use, the greater the opportunity for someone to gain unauthorized knowledge of the passwords. Scheduled changing of passwords hinders the ability of unauthorized system users to crack passwords and gain access to a system.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Password Policy >> "Maximum password age" to "60" days or less (excluding "0", which is unacceptable).

## /checks/0/description

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Password Policy.

If the value for the "Maximum password age" is greater than "60" days, this is a finding.

If the value is set to "0" (never expires), this is a finding.

## /checks/1/description

IASE supplies an OVAL check.
