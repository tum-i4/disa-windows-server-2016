## /rule

The built-in Windows password complexity policy must be enabled.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

The use of complex passwords increases their strength against attack. The built-in Windows password complexity policy requires passwords to contain at least three of the four types of characters (numbers, upper- and lower-case letters, and special characters) and prevents the inclusion of user names or parts of user names.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000069-GPOS-00037, SRG-OS-000070-GPOS-00038, SRG-OS-000071-GPOS-00039, SRG-OS-000266-GPOS-00101

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Password Policy >> "Password must meet complexity requirements" to "Enabled".

## /checks/0/description

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Account Policies >> Password Policy.

If the value for "Password must meet complexity requirements" is not set to "Enabled", this is a finding.

Note: If an external password filter is in use that enforces all four character types and requires this setting to be set to "Disabled", this would not be considered a finding. If this setting does not affect the use of an external password filter, it must be enabled for fallback purposes.

## /checks/1/description

IASE supplies an OVAL check.
