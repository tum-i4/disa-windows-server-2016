## /rule

The Deny log on as a service user right must be configured to include no accounts or groups (blank) on domain controllers.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Deny log on as a service" user right defines accounts that are denied logon as a service.

Incorrect configurations could prevent services from starting and result in a denial of service.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment >> "Deny log on as a service" to include no entries (blank).

## /checks/0/description

This applies to domain controllers. A separate version applies to other systems.

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any accounts or groups are defined for the "Deny log on as a service" user right, this is a finding.

## /checks/1/description
