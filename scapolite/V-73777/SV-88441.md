## /rule

The Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group on domain controllers.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation" user right allows the "Trusted for Delegation" setting to be changed. This could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users.

[**Documentable**]{.separator type='STIG'}

false

## /implementations/0/description

Configure the policy value for Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment >> "Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation" to include only the following accounts or groups:

- Administrators

## /checks/0/description

This applies to domain controllers. A separate version applies to other systems.

Verify the effective setting in Local Group Policy Editor.

Run "gpedit.msc".

Navigate to Local Computer Policy >> Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> User Rights Assignment.

If any accounts or groups other than the following are granted the "Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation" user right, this is a finding.

- Administrators
