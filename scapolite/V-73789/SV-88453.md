## /rule

The Load and unload device drivers user right must only be assigned to the Administrators group.

## /description

[**VulnDiscussion**]{.separator type='STIG'}

Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

The "Load and unload device drivers" user right allows a user to load device drivers dynamically on a system. This could be used by an attacker to install malicious code.
